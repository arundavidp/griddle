# Design

This doc: an overview of the design and plans around developing `griddle`.

  Fun Emoji I will use in this doc:

## Layers

> ðŸŸ¡ &nbsp;&nbsp;**Planned**

There are 3 "layers" necessary to build a terminal-based UI framework:

1. A low-level API for manipulating a terminal:

   We use a combination of `dart:io`, `dart:ffi`, and [`neoansi`][neoansi].

2. A higher-level, _canvas-like_ drawing API built upon the lower-level API.

   This package, `griddle`.

3. A framework-level, _declarative_ API for creating complex UIs simply.

   **Out of scope** of this package, to be built on top of `griddle`.

## Compatibility

> ðŸŸ¡ &nbsp;&nbsp;**Planned**

It should be possible to support all major platforms, including:

1. Desktops on all major platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
2. Web (compiled to JavaScript)
3. Mobile (using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev))

In fact, it might even be possible to directly support something like Discord.
However, everything but _desktop_ would require creating or using a terminal
_emulator_, which is additional work. Therefore, priority will be put on
_desktop_ work using native (built-in) terminals.
